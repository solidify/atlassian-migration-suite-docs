### PRO Features

#### **1. Consolidating Issue Fields**

One of the key features of the Jira to Azure DevOps Migrator PRO is the ability to consolidate issue fields. This allows you to merge multiple fields from your Jira issues into a single field in Azure DevOps based on a configurable text pattern.

To consolidate issue fields, simply add a field mapping with the `MapFieldsComposite` mapper to your `config.json` file, like this:

```json
"field-map": {
    "field": [
    ...
        {
        "source": "${description$Rendered}<br>${customfield_12345}<br>${customfield_12346}",
        "target": "System.Description",
        "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
        },
    ...
    ]
}
```

This example will concatenate the built-in `description` field with the custom fields `customfield_12345` and `customfield_12346` and output the result to the `System.Description` field in Azure DevOps. Within the `source` field, you may specify any pattern you wish, but any `${}` clause will be substituted by the value of the corresponding field. You can add the `$Rendered` suffix to any multiline field identifier in order to get the HTML value.

##### Available commands for the source pattern

Several commands are available for the **source pattern** used by the MapFieldsComposite mapper. These can be used to extend the functionality of the MapFieldsComposite and map more types of fields.

You will find information about each available command in the below section, as well as usage examples.

| Command | Descriptions | Usage | Mapper used |
|--|--|--|--|
| **$Rendered** | Used to inject the Rendered (HTML) version of certain fields like `description`. | `${[FIELD NAME]$Rendered}` | `MapRendered` |
| **.Join()** | Can be used to inject an array-type field like `components` or `fixversion` into the resulting string, with the option of specifying the delimiter. | `${[FIELD NAME].Join([DELIMITER])}` | `MapArray` |
| **.JoinTags()** | Can be used to inject the `labels` into the resulting string, with the option of specifying the delimiter. | `${[FIELD NAME].JoinTags([DELIMITER])}` | `MapTags` |
| **.User()** | Can be used to inject a mapped user identity into the resulting string, using the user mapping file. | `${[FIELD NAME].User()}` | `MapUser` |
| **.DateTime()** | Can be used to inject an date or datetime field like `created` or `duedate` into the resulting string, with the option of specifying the format of the resulting date string. Formatting reference: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings> | `${[FIELD NAME].DateTime([FORMAT])}` |  |

##### Examples

###### $Rendered, example usage

- Inject a custom field as **text** into the Work Item description:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${description$Rendered}<br>My Custom Field:${customfield_12345}",
     "target": "System.Description",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```

###### .Join(), example usage

- Concatenate two array fields with comma (,) as the delimiter:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${fixversions.Join(,),${affectedversions.Join(,)}",
     "target": "Custom.VersionsArray",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```
- Inject an array field into the Work Item desciption as a **Bullet List**:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${description$Rendered}<br><ul><li>${fixversions.Join(</li><li>)}</li></ul>",
     "target": "System.Description",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```

###### .JoinTags(), example usage

- Concatenate the Tags with a text field:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${labels.JoinTags(;)};${customfield_12345}",
     "target": "System.Tags",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```
- Concatenate the Tags with an array field:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${labels.JoinTags(;)};${fixversions.Join(;)}",
     "target": "System.Tags",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```

###### .User(), example usage

- Inject a mapped user's id/email into the Work Item desciption as body text:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${description$Rendered}<br>Reported By: ${reporter.User()}<br>Assignee: ${assignee.User()}<br>Custom User Field: ${customfield_12345.User()}",
     "target": "System.Description",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```

###### .DateTime(), example usage

- Inject the DueDate field into Work Item desciption as body text:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${description$Rendered}<br>Due date: ${duedate.DateTime()}",
     "target": "System.Description",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```
- Inject a custom datetime field into Work Item desciption as body text, with specified format:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "${description$Rendered}<br>Due date: ${duedate.DateTime(yyyy-MM-dd)}",
     "target": "System.Description",
     "mapper": "MapFieldsComposite"
   },
   ```

##### Notice about missing fields in the MapFieldsComposite source pattern

If you have source fields in your pattern which are missing data in your Jira Issues, the data will migrate, but you may experience missing fields in the pattern. Alternatively, you can set the **ignore-mapping-composite-fields-if-missing-values** boolean property in your **config.json** to True to ignore migrating composite patterns with missing field data. Then, if any of the fields (demarcated by ${}) in the pattern are missing from the source issue, no data will be migrated at all for that particular issue and field. This will affect all MapFieldsComposite field maps in your configuration.

#### **2. Migrating Releases**

Another feature of the Jira to Azure DevOps Migrator PRO is the ability to migrate releases. This feature allows you to migrate all the information related to a release, including associated issues and the `Fixes Version` and `Affects Version` fields. To migrate releases, you will need to make some modifications to the ADO WIT Process of the target project, as well as some modifications to the config file.

**Note**: if you used the **jira-migrator-bootstrapper** utility to generate your config file, this file will already be pre-filled with everything you need to migrate releases, as long as you set `ExportReleases` `true`.

Follow the steps as outlined below:

1. Create the `Release` issue type (or the equivalent issue type with the name of your choice) in the ADO WIT Process of the target project.

Creating a new work item type called "Release" in an Azure DevOps Process model and adding the custom fields involves several steps. Here's a straightforward guide to help you through the process:

##### Step-by-Step Instructions, adjusting Azure DevOps Work Item Process Model

  1. **Go to Organization Settings**: Click on the **gear icon** (âš™) at the bottom left to open Organization Settings.
  1. **Select Process**: Under the **Boards** section, click on **Process**.
  1. **Select your custom process**: Click on your newly created process.
  1. **Create a new work item type**: Click on **New work item type**.
  1. **Name your work item type**: Enter "Release" as the name and provide a description if desired.
  1. **Add icon and color**: Choose an icon and color for the new work item type, then click **Create**.

  ##### (Optional) Step-by-Step Instructions, create the FixesVersion and AffectsVersion field on the Azure DevOps Work Item Process Model

  If you wish to migrate the `fixesversion` field, you must make the following adjustment to your `Release` Work Item Type:

  1. **Select the "Release" work item type**: In your custom process, click on the "Release" work item type you just created.
  1. **Navigate to Fields**: Click on the **Fields** tab.
  1. **Add a new field**: Click on **New field**.
  1. **Configure the field**:
    - **Name**: Enter "Custom.Fixversions".
    - **Type**: Select "String" (Text field).
    - **Add to layout**: Ensure the option to add the field to the layout is checked.
  1. **Save the field**: Click **Add field** to save your changes.
  2. **Add a new field**: Click on **New field**.
  1. **Configure the field**:
    - **Name**: Enter "Custom.AffectsVersion".
    - **Type**: Select "String" (Text field).
    - **Add to layout**: Ensure the option to add the field to the layout is checked.
  1. **Save the field**: Click **Add field** to save your changes.


#### **2. Migrating Releases (contd.)**

2. Add the `export-releases`, `source-project-key` and `releases-folder` properties to your `config.json`. This will let the jira exporter know that you wish to export releases, from which project and where on the disk to put them:

    ```json
    "export-releases": true,
    "releases-folder": "Releases",
    "source-project-key": "AGILEDEMO",
    ```

3. Add the `JiraRelease` type to the `type-map` in your `config.json`. This will let the jira exporter know what Work Item Type the releases should be created as in Azure DevOps. The following sample will create the releases as the work item type `Release` (you may need to edit the Azure DevOps process model and create the desired work item type first):

    ```json
    "type-map": {
        "type": [
        {
            "source": "JiraRelease",
            "target": "Release"
        },
        ...
        ]
    },
    ```

4. Add a status mapping for the `Release` type to the `field-map` in your `config.json`. This will let the jira exporter know how to map the possible states that the releases can be in. Here is an example:

    ```json
    "field-map": {
        "field": [
            {
                "source": "status",
                "target": "System.State",
                "for": "Release",
                "mapping": {
                "values": [
                    {
                    "source": "Released",
                    "target": "1"
                    },
                    {
                    "source": "Unreleased",
                    "target": "2"
                    },
                    {
                    "source": "Archived",
                    "target": "3"
                    },
                    {
                    "source": "Overdue",
                    "target": "4"
                    }
                ]
                }
            },
        ]
    }
    ```

5. Ensure that your config file has a field mapping entry for the `fixVersions` and `versions` field, for example:

    ```json
    {
        "source": "fixVersions",
        "source-type": "id",
        "target": "Custom.Fixversions"
    },
    {
        "source": "versions",
        "source-type": "id",
        "target": "Custom.AffectsVersion"
    },
    ```

6. (Optional) you can map additional metadata for Releases using **field maps** in your config.json file. As of today, the following fields are available:

    - driver
    - startDate
    - releaseDate
    - description

    Here is an example configuration which shows how you can map the various Release fields:

    ```json
    {
        "source": "driver",
        "target": "Custom.Driver",
        "mapper": "MapUser",
        "for": "Release"
    },
    {
        "source": "startDate",
        "target": "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StartDate",
        "type": "datetime",
        "for": "Release"
    },
    {
        "source": "releaseDate",
        "target": "Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.TargetDate",
        "type": "datetime",
        "for": "Release"
    },
    {
        "source": "description",
        "target": "System.Description",
        "for": "Release"
    }
    ```

#### **3. Selecting any property for object- and array-type fields**

In order to select a certain property, create a **field map** in your configuration and use the `custom-key` field to select a JSON property.

You can either select a top-level field directly or select a field at a path by providing the full path with a dot (.) separated notation.

This feature works for both Object-type fields (map the value directly) or for arrays (using the MapArray mapper).

##### Specifying the property to map for Object-type fields

**Example scenario**: We want to extract the `emailAddress` property of the below custom field and use it in our mapper:

```json
"customfield_10012": {
    "self": "https://jira.myorg.com/rest/api/2/user?username=databaseadmins",
    "name": "databaseadmins",
    "key": "databaseadmins",
    "emailAddress": "DatabaseServices@myorg.com",
    "avatarUrls": {
        "48x48": "https://jira.myorg.com/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10232",
        "24x24": "https://jira.myorg.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10232",
        "16x16": "https://jira.myorg.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10232",
        "32x32": "https://jira.myorg.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10232"
    },
    "displayName": "Database Admins",
    "active": true,
    "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles"
},
```

**Solution**: create the following field map:

```json
{
"source": "customfield_10037",
"target": "Custom.DatabaseAdmins",
"custom-key": "emailAddress"
},
```

##### Specifying the property to map for Array-type fields

**Example scenario**: We want to extract the `id` properties of the below custom field and use it in a **MapArray** mapper:

```json
"customfield_10037": [
  {
    "self": "https://solidifydemo.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10010",
    "value": "All",
    "id": "10010"
  },
  {
    "self": "https://solidifydemo.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10011",
    "value": "None",
    "id": "10011"
  }
],
```

**Solution**: create the following field map:

```json
{
  "source": "customfield_10037",
  "target": "Custom.MultiSelect",
  "mapper": "MapArray",
  "custom-key": "id"
},
```

#### **4. Correct embedded links to Jira Issues in text fields**

The **Jira Azure DevOps Migrator PRO** tool contains an additional utility for correcting hyperlinks to other Jira Issues in your source project inside html text fields, such as Description, Repro Steps and comments. The updated fields will contain links that point to the correct Work Item in Azure DevOps instead of JIRA.

In order to enable this feature, you will need to do some edits to the Work Item form in Azure DevOps. For each work item type, you must add the field `Custom.Reference` (or however you choose to name the field). The purpose of this field is to hold the `key` of the source issue.

Now, in your `config.json` file, add the following flag (Replace `Custom.Reference` with the field name you chose in the previous step):

```json
"jira-key-reference-field": "Custom.Reference",
```

Finally, in your `config.json` file, add a field mapping for the `key field` (Again, replace `Custom.Reference` with the field name you chose in the previous step):

```json
{
  "source": "key",
  "target": "Custom.Reference"
}
```

Now the `wi-import.exe` tool is correctly configured, and will automatically update any hyperlinks to other Jira issues in your source project!

#### **5. Migrate RemoteLinks/WebLinks to Hyperlinks**

**Remote Links** (Web links) are automatically migrated with the Jira AzureDevOps Migrator PRO. No additional configuration is needed.

#### **6. Migrate Sprint dates**

**Sprint dates** are automatically migrated with the Jira AzureDevOps Migrator PRO.

In your `config.json` file, add a field mapping for the `Sprint`, like this:

```json
{
  "source": "Sprint",
  "source-type": "name",
  "target": "System.IterationPath",
  "mapper": "MapSprint"
}
```

No further configuration is needed.

#### **7. Migrate git branch links**

If you have previously migrated your BitBucket git repositories to your Azure DevOps Server/organization, you can also migrate the **development links** of the Jira Issues to the corresponding ADO Work Items.

Only **Commit** and **Branch** links are supported as of today (2024-04-18), and no other development link types.

In your configuration file, you must specify the following properties:

```json
  "include-development-links": true,
  "repository-map": {
    "repository": [
      {
        "source": "repo-name-in-bitbucket",
        "target": "repo-name-in-ado"
      }
    ]
  },
```

The **repository-map** must contain a key-value lookup table with the names of the Bitbucket git repositories and their translations in ADO.

#### **8. Support for state transition dates for workflows with custom states.**

In the Jira Azure DevOps Migrator PRO, the following ADO fields are supported for WIT processes with custom Proposed states and Completed states:

- `ActivatedDate`
- `ClosedDate`
- `ActivatedBy`
- `ClosedBy`

By default, these fields are only supported for the states **New**, **Closed** and **Done**, across all work item types.

This feature is enabled by default, and no further configuration is needed.

#### **9. Migrate the Work Log field (Time Spent, Remaining Estimate)**

```json
{
  "source": "timetracking",
  "target": "Custom.RemainingEstimateHours",
  "custom-key": "remainingEstimate"
},
{
  "source": "timetracking",
  "target": "Custom.TimeSpentHours",
  "custom-key": "timeSpent"
},
{
  "source": "timetracking",
  "target": "Custom.RemainingEstimateSeconds",
  "custom-key": "remainingEstimateSeconds"
},
{
  "source": "timetracking",
  "target": "Custom.TimeSpentSeconds",
  "custom-key": "timeSpentSeconds"
}
```
